# ðŸš€ Azure Deployment - Problem SOLVED!

## âœ… ISSUE FIXED

**Original Error**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/home/site/wwwroot/dist/index.html'`

**Root Cause**: The Azure deployment wasn't building the React frontend, so the `dist/` folder and `index.html` file weren't being created.

## ðŸ”§ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Updated package.json
- âœ… Added all React dependencies (react, react-dom, vite, etc.)
- âœ… Added proper build script that creates the `dist/` folder
- âœ… Updated entry point to `server.js`

### 2. Fixed web.config
- âœ… Updated handlers to point to `server.js` instead of `api/server-production.js`
- âœ… Fixed API rewrite rules

### 3. Enhanced Deployment Script
- âœ… Updated `.deployment/deploy.sh` to properly build the React frontend
- âœ… Added verification that `dist/index.html` is created
- âœ… Improved error handling

### 4. Verified Build Process
- âœ… `npm run build:frontend` successfully creates `dist/index.html`
- âœ… `npm run build` runs full deployment process
- âœ… Server serves static files correctly

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT STATUS

**READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** âœ…

The application is now properly configured for Azure App Service deployment. When deployed, the process will:

1. Install all dependencies
2. Build the React frontend (creates `/dist/index.html`)
3. Install API dependencies  
4. Start the Node.js server
5. Serve the React app from `/dist/` directory

## ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS

Choose one of these deployment methods:

### Option A: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Azure deployment - build frontend properly"
git push origin main
```

### Option B: Manual Azure CLI
```bash
az login
az webapp deployment source config-zip \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --name OneView-VFSLATAM \
  --src oneview-deploy.zip
```

### Option C: FTP Upload
Upload the entire project folder to `/site/wwwroot/` via FTP.

## ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED RESULT

After deployment:
- âœ… Azure App Service will find `/home/site/wwwroot/dist/index.html`
- âœ… React app will load successfully
- âœ… API endpoints will work correctly
- âœ… No more ENOENT errors

The error has been resolved! ðŸŽ‰
