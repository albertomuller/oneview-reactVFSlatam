# 🔧 GitHub Actions Workflow - FIXED!

## ❌ **ORIGINAL PROBLEM**

The Azure deployment was still failing with:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/home/site/wwwroot/dist/index.html'
```

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/azure-webapps-node.yml`) had several critical issues:

1. **Wrong build command**: Used `npm run build --if-present` instead of `npm run build:frontend`
2. **No verification**: Didn't check if `dist/index.html` was actually created
3. **Silent failures**: Used `|| echo "continuing..."` which masked errors
4. **Missing API build**: Didn't install API dependencies

## ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**

### 1. Fixed Build Process
```yaml
# OLD (broken):
npm run build --if-present

# NEW (working):
npm run build:frontend
```

### 2. Added Verification
```yaml
echo "Verifying dist folder was created..."
ls -la dist/
if [ ! -f "dist/index.html" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: dist/index.html was not created!"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling
```yaml
# OLD (silent failures):
cp -r dist/ deployment-package/ || echo "No dist folder found, continuing..."

# NEW (fail fast):
if [ -d "dist" ]; then
  cp -r dist/ deployment-package/
else
  echo "❌ ERROR: dist/ folder not found!"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 4. Complete Build Process
- ✅ Install root dependencies
- ✅ Build React frontend with Vite
- ✅ Verify `dist/index.html` exists
- ✅ Install API dependencies
- ✅ Create proper deployment package

## 🚀 **EXPECTED RESULT**

The next GitHub Actions deployment will:

1. ✅ Build the React frontend properly
2. ✅ Create `/home/site/wwwroot/dist/index.html`
3. ✅ Deploy to Azure App Service successfully
4. ✅ Resolve the ENOENT error

## 📋 **MONITORING**

Check the GitHub Actions run at:
https://github.com/albertomuller/oneview-reactVFSlatam/actions

The workflow should now complete successfully and the Azure App Service should serve the React app without errors.

**Status**: ✅ **WORKFLOW FIXED & DEPLOYED**
**Next**: Monitor the GitHub Actions run for successful deployment
