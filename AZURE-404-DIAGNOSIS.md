# 🚨 CRITICAL: Azure App Service 404 Error Diagnosis

## ❌ **CURRENT ISSUE:**
Azure Portal shows "Resource not found" - 404 error
Even the health check `/api/health` is not working

## 🔍 **POSSIBLE CAUSES:**

### **1. App Service is Down/Crashed**
The Node.js application might have crashed during startup

### **2. Wrong Startup Command**
The app might not be starting correctly

### **3. Build Issues**
The deployment might not have the correct files

### **4. Port Configuration**
The app might be listening on the wrong port

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSIS STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Check App Service Status**
1. Go to **Azure Portal** → **Oneview-VFSLATAM** → **Overview**
2. Check if the status shows "Running" or "Stopped"
3. If stopped, click **Start**

### **Step 2: Check Log Stream**
1. **Azure Portal** → **Oneview-VFSLATAM** → **Log stream**
2. Look for startup errors or crash logs
3. Share any error messages you see

### **Step 3: Verify Startup Command**
1. **Configuration** → **General settings**
2. **Startup Command** should be: `node server.js`
3. NOT: `cd api && node server-production.js`

### **Step 4: Check Deployment**
1. **Deployment Center** → Check if latest deployment succeeded
2. Look for any deployment errors

## 🚨 **MOST LIKELY ISSUES:**

### **Issue A: Wrong Entry Point**
The startup command might still be pointing to the wrong file.

**Check:** Configuration → General settings → Startup Command
**Should be:** `node server.js`

### **Issue B: Missing server.js**
The deployment might not have included `server.js` in the root directory.

### **Issue C: Port Binding**
The app might not be binding to the correct port.

## 🔍 **WHAT TO CHECK RIGHT NOW:**

1. **Is the App Service "Running"?** (Overview page)
2. **What does Log Stream show?** (Any error messages?)
3. **What's the Startup Command?** (Should be `node server.js`)

## 📋 **INFORMATION NEEDED:**

Can you check and share:
1. **App Service status** (Running/Stopped?)
2. **Any logs from Log Stream**
3. **Current Startup Command**
4. **Latest deployment status**

Once I see these details, I can pinpoint the exact issue and fix it!
